# February - June 2018 - ComIT - Node.js (HTML5, CSS, JS, MongoDB, Node.js)
# My Very First Project

This project was made as a final project during the Node.js course with ComIT. Our task was to make a dynamic website with content of our choice. I decided to make a business website, where you can find pictures, informations, tables, as well as simple online shop. In my shop you are able to add, edit and remove items.
